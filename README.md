# kattis-solutions
This repository is a storage location for my Kattis problem solutions.

In 2016, I first began experimentation with programming using LuaU. It has since evolved into a major hobby of mine due to the immensely rewarding feeling of defeating a difficult problem. In order to prove my skill in logic-based coding problems, I have decided to use Kattis to not only build my problem solving abilities, but to also learn how the same code can be executed across various programming languages.
